# English-to-Traditional-Chinese-using-sequence-to-sequence-Machine-Translation

This repository contains the code for a sequence-to-sequence machine translation project that translates English sentences into Traditional Chinese. The project is based on a simple RNN seq2seq architecture with key enhancements including sub-word tokenization, label smoothing regularization, and a learning rate scheduler.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to translate English sentences into Traditional Chinese using a sequence-to-sequence model. The model is composed of an encoder and a decoder:
- **Encoder:** Encodes the input English sentence into a vector (or sequence of vectors).
- **Decoder:** Decodes one token at a time, conditioned on the encoder output and the previously generated tokens.

## Dataset : (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sys5keuiw4C27_cG3LMyYi6v5eHJvu1L/view)

- **Training Data:**  
  - `train_dev.raw.en`: 390,112 English sentences  
  - `train_dev.raw.zh`: 390,112 corresponding Traditional Chinese sentences  
- **Test Data:**  
  - `test.raw.en`: 3,940 English sentences  
  - The Chinese test translations are undisclosed (the provided `.zh` file is pseudo translation).

## Key Components

### 1. Sub-word Tokenization

- **Purpose:**  
  - Reduce vocabulary size and address out-of-vocabulary (OOV) issues.
- **Method:**  
  - Words are split into common prefixes and suffixes.
  - This helps in handling rare words and morphological variations (e.g., "new", "_new", "_ways", etc.).

### 2. Label Smoothing Regularization

- **Purpose:**  
  - Reserve some probability mass for incorrect labels during loss calculation.
- **Benefit:**  
  - Reduces overfitting and improves generalization during training.

### 3. Learning Rate Scheduling

- **Implementation:**  
  - The learning rate increases linearly for the first `warmup_steps` and then decreases proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number.
- **Benefit:**  
  - Stabilizes training, especially in the early stages of training with transformer-based architectures.

## Training and Evaluation

- **Benchmark Model:**  
  - A simple RNN seq2seq model is implemented.
  - Expected running time is around 0.5 hours for data processing and 0.5 hours for model training.
  - The benchmark model achieves a BLEU score of approximately 15.
  
- **Improvements:**  
  - Hyperparameters such as the number of epochs, encoder/decoder layers, and embedding dimensions have been tuned.
  - A learning rate scheduler is integrated to further stabilize and improve training performance.
  
- **Evaluation Metric:**  
  - BLEU score is used for evaluating translation quality by measuring the modified n-gram precision (n=1~4) with a penalty for short sentences.

## Code Structure

- **Notebook:**  
  - `Week6_ap2938DL (1).ipynb` – Contains the full implementation including data processing, model definition, training, and prediction for machine translation.
  
- **Key Sections in the Notebook:**  
  - **Data Preprocessing:** Loading and tokenizing the English and Chinese datasets using sub-word units.
  - **Model Definition:** Implementing the seq2seq model (encoder and decoder) with label smoothing regularization.
  - **Training Loop:** Training the model with a learning rate scheduler and tuning hyperparameters.
  - **Evaluation:** Generating translations and computing the BLEU score.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of sequence-to-sequence models for machine translation from English to Traditional Chinese. By incorporating sub-word tokenization, label smoothing, and learning rate scheduling, the model achieves improved performance and training stability. All code, experiments, and generated predictions are provided in this repository.
